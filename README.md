# Simple Shell Project

The Simple Shell project is an implementation of a basic command-line interpreter in the C programming language. It aims to provide users with a command-line interface for interacting with the system by executing commands. The shell supports fundamental functionalities such as executing commands, handling environment variables, and managing paths. It offers users a simplified interface for interacting with the operating system, serving as a starting point for learning shell programming concepts and further development.This project serves as an excellent educational resource for understanding shell principles and their implementation.
